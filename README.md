# classification-labeling-tool

Yet another labeling tool... It transfers your files from one folder to many folders.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/waytobehigh/classification-labeling-tool.git

cd classification-labeling-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
streamlit run app.py
```

**Important note:** no files are transferred until `COMMIT` button is pressed.

C stands for *clear cache*, which eventually will erase all the labels you have not committed :(

R stands for *reload page*. Does not clear cache.
